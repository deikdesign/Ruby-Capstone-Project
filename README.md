## Description
  This linter promotes best CSS practices by checking for:

  * Unwanted trailing spaces at the end of lines in a file.
  * Indentation of 2 spaces at the beginning of lines where necessary.
  * Empty line at the end of the file.
  * Spaces after comma.
  * Unexpected white space before comma.
  * Expected newline after semi-colon.
  * Zero values don't need units.
